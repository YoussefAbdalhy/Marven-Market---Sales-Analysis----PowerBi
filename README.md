## This Project is based on a fictional dataset and part of “Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence” course on Udemy. 

### Project Overview:
Maven Market, is a multi-national grocery chain with locations in Canada, Mexico, and the United States.
Maven Market’s sales director requested to create a dashboard that tracks the sales performance of his team with advanced filtering options that filters the sales records by (Year, Country, and Products).

### Project Steps:
<ol> <li>Cleaned the provided data and made sure that all column in the suitable data type.</li>
     <li>Using the relationship view, I connected the tables with valid primary/ foreign keys.</li>
     <li>In order to meet the stockholders’ requirements some DAX had been used to create new columns and measures as following: 
        <ul><li>Categorize the customers depending on their priority as customers with golden membership have high priority otherwise are standard.</li>
            <li>Categorize the products depending on product price into three categories (high, mid, low).</li>
             <li>“Quantity Sold”, “Quantity Returned” and “Return Rate” are measures had been created to evaluate the quantity of products that had been sold and the                           percentage of returned products due to any reasons (manufactured defects, …... etc.).</li>
             <li>In order to measure the number of transactions that took place during weekends compared to weekdays, “weekend Transactions” and “weekend Transactions %”                       are new measures had been created.</li>
             <li>To measure the sales KPIs as Maven Market sales director requested new measures had beet calculated (Total Revenue, Total Cost, Total Profit, Profit                            Margin) based on the transaction quantity, product cost, and product retail price found in Maven Market’s records. </li>
              <li>And to evaluate the mentioned KPIs new measures had been calculated to be able to track the sales performance such as “Revenue Target” based on 5% lift                        over the pervious month revenue.</li>
                  <li>Also “Last Month Transactions”, “Last Month Profit”, and “Last Month Returns” had been created to compare the current month transactions with last                        month.</li></ul></li></ol>
